The files you're referring to, namely `app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk`, `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk`, and `app-x86_64-release.apk`, are APK files generated for different Android architectures. Each APK is optimized for a specific type of CPU architecture, allowing your Flutter app to run efficiently on devices with different processor architectures.

Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **`app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk`**:
   - This APK is optimized for devices using the ARM architecture with a 32-bit instruction set.
   - Commonly found in many Android smartphones and tablets.

2. **`app-arm64-v8a-release.apk`**:
   - This APK is optimized for devices using the ARM64 architecture with a 64-bit instruction set.
   - Found in newer Android devices with 64-bit processors.

3. **`app-x86_64-release.apk`**:
   - This APK is optimized for devices using the x86_64 architecture with a 64-bit instruction set.
   - Typically found in some Android emulators and certain Intel-based Android devices.

The purpose of having multiple APKs for different architectures is to ensure that your Flutter app can run efficiently on a wide range of Android devices. When a user downloads your app from the Google Play Store, the appropriate APK will be served based on their device's architecture.

Flutter's build system automatically generates these APKs during the build process, providing broad compatibility. If your app includes native code or libraries, such as through the use of plugins or dependencies, having APKs for different architectures becomes crucial to cover a diverse set of Android devices.

When distributing your app, you typically upload all these APKs to the Google Play Store. Users will then receive the version that matches their device's architecture when they download and install your app.
