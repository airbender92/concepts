------------------------------
The `output` property in the Rollup configuration defines how the bundled code should be generated. In this case, it's an array containing two output configurations:

1. **ESM (ECMAScript Module) Output:**
   - **file:** Specifies the path where the output file should be written. In this case, it's `'dist/esm/index.js'`.
   - **format:** Indicates the module format for the output. Here, it's set to `'esm'` for ECMAScript Module.
   - **globals:** Defines a map of external dependencies to global variables. This is relevant when the bundled code is intended to be used in an environment where certain dependencies are expected to be available globally. In this example, it indicates that the 'react' module should be available as the global variable 'React', and 'react-dom' should be available as 'ReactDOM'.

2. **CommonJS (CJS) Output:**
   - **file:** Specifies the path where the CommonJS format output file should be written. In this case, it's `'dist/cjs/index.js'`.
   - **format:** Indicates the module format for the output. Here, it's set to `'cjs'` for CommonJS.

These output configurations allow you to generate two different versions of your bundled code, each tailored for a specific module system.

- The ESM output is suitable for environments that support ECMAScript modules, such as modern browsers and environments like Node.js with the `--experimental-modules` flag or a compatible version.

- The CommonJS output is suitable for environments that use the CommonJS module system, which is common in Node.js applications.

By having both ESM and CommonJS outputs, you provide flexibility for users or environments with different module system requirements. They can choose the output format that best fits their needs.

This script is a configuration file for the Rollup module bundler. It defines how your TypeScript code should be bundled and processed. Let's break down the key parts:

1. **Imports:**
   - `path`: Node.js module for working with file and directory paths.
   - `babel`: Rollup plugin for transpiling code using Babel.
   - `resolve`: Rollup plugin to resolve module dependencies.
   - `terser`: Rollup plugin for minifying the generated code.
   - `typescript`: Rollup plugin for handling TypeScript files.

2. **Variables:**
   - `shouldMinify`: A boolean flag indicating whether the code should be minified. It depends on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable; if it's set to 'production', minification will be enabled.
   - `bundle`: An array of dependencies that should not be bundled but treated as external dependencies.

3. **Configuration Object:**
   - **input:** Specifies the entry point for the bundling process, which is `'./src/index.ts'`.
   - **output:** An array of output configurations:
      - One for ECMAScript Module (ESM) format, writing to `'dist/esm/index.js'`.
      - One for CommonJS (CJS) format, writing to `'dist/cjs/index.js'`.
   - **external:** A function that determines which modules should be treated as external dependencies. It excludes modules starting with '.', absolute paths, and those listed in the `bundle` array.
   - **plugins:** An array of Rollup plugins:
      - `resolve()`: Resolves external dependencies.
      - `typescript()`: Handles TypeScript files, with specific configuration options.
      - `babel()`: Transpiles TypeScript to JavaScript using Babel, with specified presets and plugins.
      - `terser()`: Minifies the code when `shouldMinify` is true.

This configuration is designed for a TypeScript project using Rollup as the bundler. It transpiles TypeScript code using Babel, resolves module dependencies, and optionally minifies the output for production builds. The external dependencies specified in the `external` function won't be bundled but are expected to be provided separately (e.g., via a CDN or in the consuming environment).
