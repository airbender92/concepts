`webpack-cli` is the Command Line Interface (CLI) for Webpack. It is a separate package that provides a set of commands and tools for running and managing webpack builds from the command line. The CLI is especially useful for automating build processes and integrating webpack into your project workflow.

Here are some key points about `webpack-cli`:

1. **Installation:** You can install `webpack-cli` globally or locally in your project, depending on your preference and needs. To install it globally, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g webpack-cli
    ```

    To install it locally in your project, you can use:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev webpack-cli
    ```

2. **Commands:** `webpack-cli` provides various commands that you can run in the terminal to perform different tasks related to webpack. For example:
   
    - `webpack`: Run the default webpack build based on the configuration in your project.
    - `webpack --config mywebpack.config.js`: Run webpack with a specific configuration file.
    - `webpack --watch`: Watch for changes in your source files and automatically rebuild when changes are detected.
    - `webpack-dev-server`: Start the webpack development server for a live development environment with features like hot module replacement.

3. **Configuration:** You can configure webpack by creating a webpack configuration file (typically named `webpack.config.js`). The configuration file specifies various settings such as entry points, output paths, loaders, and plugins. When you run `webpack-cli`, it uses the configuration file to determine how to build your project.

4. **Integration with npm Scripts:** `webpack-cli` is often used in conjunction with npm scripts. You can define custom scripts in your project's `package.json` file that use `webpack-cli` commands. This allows you to run complex build processes with a simple npm command.

Here's a basic example of using `webpack-cli` in an npm script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack"
}
```

With this configuration, you can run `npm run build` in the terminal to execute the webpack build.

Overall, `webpack-cli` is a powerful tool that facilitates the use of webpack in your projects, making it easier to manage and automate the build process for your web applications.
