`ts-loader` is a TypeScript loader for webpack. It is used to integrate TypeScript with webpack, allowing you to seamlessly use TypeScript in your web development workflow. Webpack is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications, and `ts-loader` enhances webpack's capabilities to handle TypeScript files.

Here are some key points about `ts-loader`:

1. **TypeScript Integration:** `ts-loader` allows you to use TypeScript files (.ts or .tsx) in your webpack project. It takes care of transpiling TypeScript code into JavaScript that can be understood by browsers.

2. **Webpack Loader:** In the context of webpack, a loader is a module that transforms files before they are added to the bundle. `ts-loader` is a loader specifically designed for TypeScript.

3. **Performance:** `ts-loader` is known for its good performance. It can be more efficient in terms of build times compared to some other TypeScript loaders.

4. **Configurability:** It provides a range of options that you can configure in your webpack configuration file to customize how TypeScript files are transpiled and processed.

Here's a basic example of how you might configure `ts-loader` in your webpack configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        use: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.js'],
  },
};
```

This configuration tells webpack to use `ts-loader` for files with extensions `.ts` or `.tsx`. The `exclude: /node_modules/` ensures that TypeScript files in the `node_modules` directory are not processed by `ts-loader`. The `resolve.extensions` part is there to allow imports without specifying the file extensions.

Using `ts-loader` simplifies the integration of TypeScript into webpack projects and allows you to leverage the features provided by both technologies in your web development workflow.
